Robotic automation is becoming more and more distinguished in the current world across many different professions and occupations and is widely considered. This project shows a novel method for controlling a whole robotic arm using hand motions, gestures, or buttons in place of conventional joysticks and buttons is presented. The main objective is to alter public perceptions about how remote controls work for manually operated robotic arms. In industrial settings, pick-and-place robots are frequently utilised to carry out specified duties. This study's system is made to reduce human interference and error, resulting in more accurate work. The used control method is straightforward, adaptable, and energy-efficient. Human intervention can be troublesome in a variety of circumstances, yet processes still need to be run and monitored for product versatility.
